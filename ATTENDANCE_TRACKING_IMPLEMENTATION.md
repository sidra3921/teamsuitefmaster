# Attendance System: Implementation Guide

## Overview

The attendance system has been enhanced to ensure that check-in and check-out actions are properly saved and displayed in the attendance overview screens. This document explains how the attendance data flows through the application.

## Key Components

### 1. AttendanceService (services/attendance_service.dart)
- Provides methods to interact with attendance API endpoints
- Supports both real API mode and mock mode via AppConfig
- Key methods:
  - `markAttendance()`: Records check-in/check-out actions
  - `getTodayAttendance()`: Retrieves today's attendance status
  - `getAttendanceHistory()`: Retrieves attendance history

### 2. MockApiService (services/mock_api_service.dart)
- Provides mock implementations of API endpoints
- Stores attendance data in memory between calls
- Simulates server-side data persistence

### 3. AttendanceMarkScreen (modules/attendance/attendance_mark_screen.dart)
- UI for marking attendance (check-in/check-out)
- Displays current attendance status
- Refreshes data after each action

### 4. AttendanceViewScreen (modules/attendance/attendance_view_screen.dart)
- Displays attendance history and summary
- Loads real data from AttendanceService
- Shows monthly statistics

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. User marks attendance (check-in or check-out) on the AttendanceMarkScreen
2. AttendanceService.markAttendance() is called
3. In mock mode, MockApiService stores the attendance record in memory
4. AttendanceService.getTodayAttendance() is automatically called to refresh the UI
5. When user opens AttendanceViewScreen, the attendance history is loaded from the service

### Key Improvements
1. **In-Memory Storage**: MockApiService now maintains attendance records between API calls
2. **Auto-Refresh**: After marking attendance, today's attendance data is automatically refreshed
3. **Better Data Parsing**: Improved parsing of API response data
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to attendance records are immediately visible in all screens
5. **Consistent Error Handling**: All API operations have proper error handling

## Implementation Details

### In-Memory Storage (MockApiService)
```dart
// Stores attendance data in memory
static Map<String, dynamic> _todayAttendance = {};
static List<Map<String, dynamic>> _attendanceHistory = [];
```

### Marking Attendance
```dart
// After marking attendance, fetch the updated today's attendance
// to ensure UI reflects the change immediately
await getTodayAttendance();
```

### Data Format
Attendance records follow this structure:
```dart
{
  'date': '2025-08-11',
  'checkIn': '09:00 AM',
  'checkOut': '06:00 PM',
  'hours': 9.0,
  'status': 'Present'
}
```

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `test/api_test.dart` to verify:
1. Attendance marking works correctly
2. Today's attendance can be retrieved
3. Attendance history can be retrieved
4. The attendance record is updated after marking attendance

## Future Improvements
1. Local storage for offline operation
2. More detailed attendance statistics
3. Calendar view for attendance visualization

## Troubleshooting
If attendance records are not appearing in the overview:
1. Verify that the mock mode is properly enabled/disabled in AppConfig
2. Check the console logs for any API errors
3. Verify that both check-in and check-out are using the same date format
4. Refresh the attendance view screen to load the latest data
